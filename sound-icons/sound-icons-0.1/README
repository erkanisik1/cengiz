This package contains a small set of sound icons, primarily intended to
be used with Speech Dispatcher (look at
http://www.freebsoft.org/projects/speechd/ for more information about
Speech Dispatcher).

Currently, there are only the most basic sound icons present.  In
future, we plan to build rather extensive collection of sound icons,
serving for many signalling purposes in applications.

If you want to contact us about this package, you can write to the
address speechd@freebsoft.org.
